# netdata-iptmon
A netdata plugin for OpenWRT IPTMon

A very early - but working - version of a plugin to monitor per device throughput (KBytes) of hosts monitored by IPTMon on an OpenWRT System.

It has no dependencies other than what netdata and IPTMon already have, ie bash >= 4.0.
Tested on OpenWRT 19.07
